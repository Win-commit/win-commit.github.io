I'm a senior at Nanjing University, China now and I'm finding a PhD position. 

I'm now at [Dislab](https://dislab.nju.edu.cn/) in Nanjing University, with [Professor](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lwz) WenZhong Li. And I was lucky enough to work with Professor [Jordan](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jbg/) at UMD for six months.

I am interested in NLP research. Specifically, I want to explore Safety of LLM or LLM-based system; Explanation and Robustness of LLM; Human-centered LLM design.

For Publications: I only have one paper submitted for ARR Decemeber(OA:3.5/3.5/2, Confidence:4/4/3). Hope I can get my first publication soon :).
